# Commands cheat sheet

- git init (to start the git repo)
- npm init -y (create package.json with default values)
- npm install parcel (to install parcel)
- npm install react react-dom react-router-dom (to install these packages)

To install packages:
- npm install <packageName>
For example:
- npm install jest
- npm install jsdom
- npm install jest-environment-jsdom

These will show up in package.json (in the example, I have moved them from "dependencies" to "devDependencies")

Use "--save-dev" as an option if you want to install as a devDependency

- npm install --save-dev <packageName>
